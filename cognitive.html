            <h2>About CBT</h2>
            <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a structured, time-limited psychotherapy that aims to address the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It is based on the premise that negative thought patterns can lead to emotional distress and maladaptive behaviors. By identifying and challenging these thoughts, individuals can learn to develop healthier thinking patterns and coping strategies.</p>
            <p>CBT is effective for a variety of mental health issues, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety Disorders</li>
                <li>Depression</li>
                <li>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</li>
                <li>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</li>
                <li>Eating Disorders</li>
                <li>Phobias</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Research has shown that CBT can lead to significant improvements in mental health and well-being, making it a popular choice for therapy.</p>
