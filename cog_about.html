    <h2>About CBT</h2>
    <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a structured, time-limited psychotherapy that focuses on the interconnected relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It is based on the principle that our thoughts influence our emotions, which in turn affect our actions. CBT aims to identify and change negative thought patterns to promote emotional well-being and healthier behavioral responses.</p>
    <p>CBT is highly evidence-based and is often considered the gold standard for treating various psychological issues. It involves collaborative work between the therapist and the client to set goals, develop coping strategies, and monitor progress over time.</p>
    <p>Sessions typically involve techniques like cognitive restructuring, behavioral experiments, mindfulness practices, and problem-solving skills to address distressing patterns effectively. The therapy is short-term, usually spanning 8–20 sessions, and provides tools that can be applied long after the therapy ends.</p>
